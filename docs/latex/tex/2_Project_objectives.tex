\item Design and implement a web application that uses the model.
\item Get insights about the data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technical objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item Develop a \textit{machine learning} model that using songs can detect the musical style automatically based on various features.
\item Evaluate machine learning model with various metrics and graphics.
\item Implement unitary and integration tests.
\item Develop a web application using a Python framework like Flask.
\item Deploy the application with the trained model online in a platform like Heroku.
\item Use a version control system as Git to track individual changes in the code.
\item Follow an Agile methodology as SCRUM to manage the project development.
