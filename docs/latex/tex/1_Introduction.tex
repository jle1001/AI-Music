\section{Context}

Music is a culturally significant and important element, with a wide variety of styles and genres.
The automated identification of musical styles is an emerging field of study, aiming to create intelligent systems capable of automatically recognizing and classifying the musical style of a song or music piece without any human intervention.

This field of study has important applications in areas such as music recommendation or digital audio library organization.

The application of artificial intelligence algorithms has shown considerable success in this area.

The present work aims to develop an automatic music style recognition system using audio processing and artificial intelligence algorithms.
